This is my zmk config for a wireless, split, ortholinear, column staggered, and direct wired board using a Nice!Nano controller.
A bit of a WIP, I'm still trying to figure out if I want to handle steno stuff on the firmware of the keyboard or on the software on the computer.

mira_right.keymap does nothing, you can ignore it
should eventually check if i actually need it but im too lazy for that rn
